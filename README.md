# Iris-Logistic-Regression

In this project, I developed a logistic regression model to classify two types of Iris flowers—Iris-setosa and Iris-virginica—based on sepal length and width. The project utilized data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Key steps included data segregation, visualization of distributions, an 80:20 train-test split with balanced class distribution, and implementation of gradient descent for model training.

- Achieved a perfect 100% test accuracy.
- Plotted training accuracy and cost against epochs, demonstrating model convergence.
- Final model weights were [2.919, -4.851] with a bias of -1.205, indicating the significant influence of sepal width in classification.
